# Pauper Guessing Game
This is a guessing game for Magic: The Gathering streamers. Fill dead air by providing your viewers with a fun guessing game. The game is currently configured to only show cards printed at common rarity.

To use the game in your stream crop the browser window to the black box in your streaming software. The card will be revealed in 1 minute. Refresh the browser for a new card.

There is currently a more polished PHP-based version available for download, which you can upload to your own web server, and a Javascript-based version hosted on Github pages.
